# fit-tools

some basic tools to work with Garmin FIT files. The main idea was to convert FIT files to standard GPX files, so I could use them with [gpxpy](https://github.com/tkrajina/gpxpy) and [gpx-cmd-tools](https://github.com/tkrajina/gpx-cmd-tools).

Make sure you have [gpxpy](https://github.com/tkrajina/gpxpy) and [fitparse](https://github.com/dtcooper/python-fitparse) installed for this to work!
